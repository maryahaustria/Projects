Maryah Austria
Hello! I'm Maryah Austria, and I'm currently pursuing a Master's in Applied Information Technology with a concentration in Machine Learning, set to graduate in December 2024. My passion lies in using data to solve everyday problems and enhancing machine performance to make our lives more efficient and effective.

I'm actively seeking an internship where I can apply my expertise in machine learning and natural language processing. My career aspiration is to become a data scientist, specializing in machine learning or artificial intelligence. I find it incredibly exciting to uncover insights from data and drive innovation through technology.

Before venturing into data science, I worked in healthcare as a medical assistant. This experience reignited my passion for data and provided me with a unique perspective on how data-driven solutions can transform various industries, especially healthcare.

Outside of my professional interests, I enjoy playing pickleball and spending time with my Golden Doodle. These hobbies help me maintain a balanced and creative lifestyle.

Thank you for visiting my GitHub profile. I'm excited to connect with fellow enthusiasts and explore new opportunities in the field of data science!
